/**
 Agent is the basic interface for any class that wants to act as an agent
 in JNS.<br>
 Agents are 'attached' to each other in JNS. Normally, the user will 'attach'
 a higher-level agent to a lower-level agent (for example TCP to IP). This
 agent will then call back the higher-level agent and 'attach' itself.
 So there is a two-way attachment: user attaches higher-level to lower-level
 and lower-level attaches itself to higher level (the latter process is
 transparent to the outside user).
