<P>Obviously, agents are not naturally inclined to run on top of each other. They 
somehow have to be attached to each other, for example TCP has to be attached
to IP.
<P>In JNS, the order is that <I>higher-level agents attach to lower-level agents</I>. For example, in order to attach TCP to IP you would use the following
code:
<HR>
<PRE>
     ip_instance.attach(tcp_instance,Protocols.TCP);
</PRE>
<HR>

The Protocols.TCP parameter is an identifier by which the lower-level protocol
can identify packets and what higher-level agents they should be given to. In
the case of IP, all IP packets that have the protocol field set to 'TCP' will
be given to 'tcp_instance' now.
<P>
<P>When the 'attach' function is called, the lower-level protocol will subsequently reverse-attach itself to the higher-level protocol. This is in order to give
the higher level protocol a chance to obtain a reference to the lower level. In the previous example 'tcp_instance' had no way to get a reference to
'ip_instance'. So <I>ip_instance.attach(...)</I> will call back the following
function:
<HR>
<PRE>
       Tcp.attach(Agent lower_level)
</PRE>
<HR>

to do the reverse attachment.
<P>
<P>For some detail on how all of this actually work, I'd recommend you look at
the jns/trace/SimpleGoBackN.java source file and Test_GoBackN.java. The former
is a protocol that attaches to IP.
