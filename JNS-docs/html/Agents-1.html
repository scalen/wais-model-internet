<P>This file will introduce you to the world of protocols in JNS. Protocols are
built using a layered approach (like in any network these days). The bottom
layer protocol in JNS is IP and everything else builds on top of that.
<P>There are three interfaces available for implementing agents: <B>Agent</B>,
which is the most generic class of agents, not normally used, <B>CL_Agent</B>, which specifies the interface for connection-less agents and <B>CO_Agent</B> which is used for connection-oriented services (this does not mean that the
service has to be reliable though!).
<P>Any of these interfaces can be implemented to form new agents.
