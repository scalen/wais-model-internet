This is version 0.2 of Javis, quite probably the final version. What you
have in this package is the complete Java source code.

Requirements:
	- JDK 1.1.7
	- Swing 1.0.3

The previous two have to be in your classpath prior to compiling Javis. If 
you just require the applet version then you do not need swing.

NOTE: If you have the JDK 1.2, it is easy enough to port Javis to that if
you want to put some effort in: All you have to do is rename all 'include'
statements from
    include com.sun.java.awt.swing;
to
    include javax.swing;
Only the swing classes in the iface/ package contain such include
statements.


Running Javis (Standalone)
--------------------------

You need to compile Javis before running it. Assuming that your classpath is
set correctly, you can simply type:

	javac Main.java

After the compilation, type

	java Main


Running Javis (Applet)
----------------------

There are two steps involved in running the applet: Compiling Javis and
setting up a web page to contain the Javis applet.

Compile the applet version of Javis by typing:

	javac MainApplet.java

You can now create a HTML page that refers to the MainApplet class and pass
it the required parameters (trace file, etc.). It is easiest to look at the
applet_example.html provided for the details. Note the following:
 
        1) All the class files have to be installed in their correct paths,
	i.e. you should copy the whole directory structure when putting
        Javis in your web directory. You can then get rid of the .java files
        because they are not needed anymore (but the resources/ directory 
        is!)

        2) Take care to get the access permissions right. Web servers are
	very pedantic!


Have fun using Javis..
