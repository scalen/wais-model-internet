28/01/2006 (gabi kliot):
  - fileio.event.NodeEvent - added support for exact coordinates
  - fileio.event.GroupEvent - compilation problem
  - animation.Scheduler  - added support for exact layout
  - iface.Swing*. - compilation problems
  - animation.layout.ExactLayoutManager - added support for exact layout


23/04/1999 (chris):
  - Lots and lots of commenting
  - Added 'seek' functionality.
  - Added 'arrowheads' to packets in order to be able to distinguish packets  
    that are sent back-to-back from one big packet.
  - Fixed link colouring. Broken links are drawn red now.
  - Updated the applet accordingly

22/04/1999 (chris):
  - Merged with Steve's modifications
  - Lots of smaller bugfixes (e.g. queues get deleted when new files are
    loaded)
  - Added a proper animation for dropping packets. Packets rotate now.
  - Implemented proper packet length routine (rather than hardcode).
    Blatantly ripped it from the NAM source (it did require some adjustment
    though).

21/04/1999 (chris):
  - Finished the Preferences dialog. Values get saved.

15/04/1999 (chris):
  - Merged with steve's changes. got queuing and text events now, joy..
  - Added packet colouring. Packets are coloured according to the
    conversation ID now.

14/04/1999 (chris):
  - Added the 'shake' function, finally.. It actually comes in quite handy
    if the autolayout messes up the layout (for straight-line type networks)
  - Activated both the 'tension' and the 'iteration' text field in the swing
    interface. Tip of the day: Try tension=40 with test.jvs.gz, looks better
    IMHO.
  - Updated the applet: Added tension and iteration fields and activated all
    of the things described above.
  - Applet: Renamed "FFWD" to "Forward" ..

04/04/1999 (chris):
  - Back from JNS for a bit, implemented Queue handling so Steven can do the
    rest tomorrow.
  - Added queue.nam.gz for testing queue behaviour.. You should be able to
    observe a queue after about 1,2 seconds at node 2 (that is, after we've
    implemented it.. ;)

01/03/1999 (chris):
  - I'm a bit knackered from coding on JNS, but I've added the about dialog
    so that's out of the TODO list. I might make it more fancy later.

28/02/1999 (chris):
  - Colour handling is back in. Things get displayed now but I had to take
    out double buffering from the applet. The colour database can be loaded
    over a network now
  - OOPS.. 1:30 am .. double buffering is back in, the applet seems to work
    fine. Have a drink on me.. I'll try it in Netscape now.
  - Ok, it looks like Netscape just went to its knees. The applet works but
    Netscape starts behaving like a monkey on sedatives, it even stops 
    displaying its buttons. There seem to be threading problems. JIT
    compiler in Navigator.. hmm..
  - Fixed the time-reset bug. Time gets set to 0 when loading a new file
    now.
  - Created a seek icon "seek.gif" to go with the lovely new seek button
  - Redrew the old and ugly "stop" and "play" icons. The whole interface is
    self-made now.
  - Contributed the compare-cvs script from my graphics library..

27/02/1999 (chris):
  - Packet drawing is back, but not quite complete.. I have to rething it
    a bit. In any case, you get some nice boxes drawn now :)
  - Reading in the '-S' flag in packet events now.. have to look up what it
    actually does.
  - The applet is loading now and it is even loading the trace file. I had
    to disable the colour class as it was trying to load the database.. 
    nothing on the screen yet

25/02/1999 (chris):
  - Included Denis' preferences loading / saving stuff, seems to work fine..
  - Totally broke the packet drawing :)

24/02/1999 (denis):
  - Wrote the preferences loading / saving

24/02/1999 (chris):
  - Messed around with the applet code a bit, it refuses to load in Netscape
  - Denis wrote Preferences loading / saving, not incorporated yet..
  - Added gzipped file reading and loading files over a network (recognises
    http:// in the filename)

22/02/1999 (chris):
  - Added the 'debug console', no more stdout debug messages. A couple of
    new icons to go with it
  - Removed the reverse play button and rewind button
  - Fixed the time increment slider (finally!) It uses a scale of 10^x now,
    which is exactly what NAM does

[BREAK]

08/12/1998:
  - Changed the panel interfacing structure, everything has been
    abstracted and the swing and applet interface can be exchanged
    transparently.
  - Created the applet interface (looks horrible :)
  - index.html to test the applet

07/12/1998:
  - First checkin, swing interface working
