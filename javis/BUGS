- Link bandwidth only accepted if specified in floating point, no "mb" 
  appendix, etc. same for delay, only floating point, no "ms". If it's
  urgent, edit the file by hand to convert to floating point.

- Threads do not get joined when they terminate most of the time. This is
  because it's tedious to do and might well be left out of the prototype
  (no problem, but creates a memory leak)

- Autolayout will not centre correctly anymore if the screen is resized

- Orientations and angles (i.e. manual layout) specified in trace files are 
  being ignored.

- The drawing routine determines the font width every time, making it
  slow

- Redo button causes an exception when pressed without a file loaded

- In X-windows, some window managers will provide the top position of the 
  window starting from the title bar, some will provide the position of the
  actual content, thus the debug console might be shifted up sometimes by
  exactly the height of the title bar..
